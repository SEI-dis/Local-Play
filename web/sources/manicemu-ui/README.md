## Source-to-port mapping (modified 2026-10-09)

| Upstream source | Web implementation |
| --- | --- |
| GameListView.shouldSelectItemAt / Game.handleTapAction / GameInfoDetailView.startGameButton | src/app.js: library and history selection share showDetails; src/game-info.js: explicit Play starts the core. The Web UI always uses the details-first route requested for this port. Selecting/closing a game does not load its core or change save sessions/playtime. |
| FlexSkinSettingViewController / FlexItemView / SkinSettingsView | src/control-editor.js, src/control-layout.js, style.css and src/app.js: separate screen/button editing modes, inactive-layer dimming, drag/pinch, aspect-preserving corner resize, reset and skin-settings entry. Web slider, keyboard access and explicit save/cancel retain draft persistence. |
| GameInfoView / GameInfoNavigationView / GameInfoDetailView / GameInfoCoverView | src/game-info.js, src/manic-ui.js, native-menu.css and index.html: game-detail sheet, info/more tools, cover, editable title, played time, fixed play/safe-mode header and independently scrolling options. |
| GameOption.defaultGroupAndSort | src/manic-ui.js: gameOptionGroups preserves the source group/order after unsupported entries are removed. src/app.js: showGameMenu supplies the available controls. |
| GameOption.Shortcut default list; GameOptionsView.getListPage(.gaming) | MENU title and quit/reload/saveState/quickLoadState navigation shortcuts. No custom resume banner or action-tile grid. Close resumes the game. |
| ASListPage / ASListItemView / ASNavigationView | Shared grouped rows, leading icons, trailing value/switch/chevron, compact navigation tools and close button in native-menu.css, style.css, index.html and src/app.js. |
| SaveStateListView.getSaveStatesSection / segmented control / editing actions | src/manic-ui.js: stateRow. src/app.js: showStates. Manual/automatic tabs, thumbnail, number, date, Continue button; editing replaces Continue with selection checkboxes. Select-all and confirmed deletion. Automatic tab opens first when no manual state exists. |
| GameOptionPerform | Browser equivalents for save, quick load, volume, speed, screenshot, skin, cheat, restart and exit actions. |
| ImportServiceListView / ImportMottoCollectionViewCell / ImportFileCollectionViewCell / ImportServiceListCollectionViewCell / ImportFooterCollectionReusableView | src/app.js and style.css: the top artwork, full-width Files card, two-column local-service cards and dashed drop hint. Skin settings and per-game save import reuse existing local flows. Cloud/LAN/download, clipboard, multi-disc and patching services are omitted. Artwork and vector icons are original Web replacements. Original references and credits are retained. |
| SettingsListView / SettingItem | General, advanced, support and other groups; appearance controls, automatic states, controller skins and grouped settings rows in src/app.js and style.css. |

UIKit layout and Realm persistence are replaced with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and
IndexedDB. This is a source-based port, not the execution of Swift/UIKit in a browser.
Each upstream filename can be located in the pinned repository; the three AS*
files are from ManicEmu/ManicEmu/Sources/Business/Common (Models and Views).
The Web source archive contains these references,
the editable implementation, modification notices and the license.

## Subtractions and necessary Web adaptations

- Native purchases, iCloud/account features, achievements and unsupported
  per-core/device options are omitted. State-file import/export is not exposed.
- Native importSave/shareSave have their own rows, also available before play.
  Existing local battery-save backups remain available from the additional
  save-data row while playing. Checkpoints use the native automatic-state tab.
- Manual saves append instead of overwriting. Existing numbered slots remain
  readable. Selected manual records are deleted in one transaction only after
  confirmation. Automatic checkpoints stay read-only to preserve crash recovery.
- Recovery prompts, corruption checks, cross-tab locks and restart confirmations
  preserve the existing Web safety features. Loading checkpoints remains local.
- The native Japanese manual/automatic tab labels are shortened to 手動 / 自動
  under the セーブステート title. Continue remains 続ける. Narrow views reflow
  controls below labels instead of squeezing text into vertical columns.
- Browser-only full-screen and FPS controls use the same row component. The
  local save-data page uses the same grouping, without a separate tile layout.
- Native images and Apple system symbols are not copied. Replacement vector
  icons and standard-skin source artwork are authored for this AGPL Web port.
  No third-party skin, game ROM, dumped proprietary BIOS, game image or downloaded
  font is bundled. Open-source replacement BIOS implementations keep their licenses.

## Game-detail behavior (modified 2026-10-09)

GameInfo references are from ManicEmu/ManicEmu/Sources/Business/GameInfo/VIews/.
The source views guide spacing, the red accent, rounded groups, switches
and the pinned header. Native-only controls are filtered by available capabilities.
Safe mode suppresses cheats and automatic state recovery for the launch; saved
data remains intact. Preferences for audio, video and input remain global in the
Web model (skin/control-layout overrides retain their existing per-game behavior).
Played duration is recorded from this version onward; older playtime is not inferred.
Option sorting and navigation shortcut choices persist locally. ROM sharing and
its file-download fallback were removed on 2026-10-09. Save-data export remains.
The launch link identifies a game already stored in the same browser.

## Layout editor (modified 2026-10-09)

FlexSkinSettingViewController is from Business/Skin/ViewControllers; FlexItemView
and SkinSettingsView are from Business/Skin/Views at the same pinned revision.
Unmodified files and original notices are retained. The Web editor applies sizes
to artwork and hit rectangles together, stores positions/sizes by orientation and
keeps the previous per-game/shared preference model. Unlike upstream free-form
screen edge resizing, this port preserves aspect ratio and clamps to the viewport.
NDS moves/resizes each screen independently and retains legacy grouped layouts.
Imported skins stay unmodified.

The editor styles now live in control-editor.css. Screen and button layers are
explicit in editing, preview and gameplay; buttons keep their saved opacity while
overlapping video. Unlike upstream mode dimming, inactive items retain their
actual opacity so the overlap can be judged. src/control-alignment.js adds original
Web grid/snapping, guides, centering, level and mirror placement helpers.

## Shared controls and local artwork (modified 2026-10-09)

Settings rows/groups/switches use src/ui.js, settings pages use
src/settings-view.js, skin selection/layout settings use src/skin-settings.js,
and state dialogs use src/state-dialogs.js. controls.css defines the shared red
buttons and inputs.
Screen-specific styles retain placement; the bottom tabs retain their gradient.

The cover-change sheet retains GameInfoCoverView's local image selection. External
catalog/search/automatic download code has been removed from the publication
candidate. Existing cover pixels remain local; no third-party cover is shipped.
Game Info identifies the selected core and offers compatible alternate cores.
The switch is unavailable during play; save/state records are isolated per core. Native purchase/cloud/account/3DS-only controls remain omitted.

## Game selection (reviewed 2026-10-09)

The selection/start split was rechecked against the same pinned revision:
[GameListView.swift](https://github.com/Manic-EMU/ManicEMU/blob/fbaeab79c214d5920bb51afa6f2d786fb2b12a58/ManicEmu/ManicEmu/Sources/Business/Games/Views/GameListView.swift)
calls `game.handleTapAction()` for normal selection;
[Game.swift](https://github.com/Manic-EMU/ManicEMU/blob/fbaeab79c214d5920bb51afa6f2d786fb2b12a58/ManicEmu/ManicEmu/Sources/Business/Play/Models/Game.swift)
opens GameInfoView unless quick-start is enabled/forced. GameInfoDetailView's Play
button explicitly passes `forceQuick: true`. This port always opens details from
library/history selection; Play, safe-mode Play and state Continue remain explicit
launch actions. There is no quick-start preference in this Web version.

The retained GameOptionsView `.gameInfo` / `.gaming` scene split and
GameOption.defaultGroupAndSort / availableOptions were also rechecked. The Web
port shares grouped-option components between the two scenes, includes only the
available core/browser controls, and retains the separate title/play section.

## Publication audit (2026-10-09)

The bundled Swift references were compared byte-for-byte with the pinned Git
objects. Additional library/navigation references retain their original authors
and notices. Web settings preserve the native general/advanced/support/other
grouping; Web-only storage, offline/update, recovery and accessibility controls
use the same row components. Framework bindings, geometry, original skin art,
network safeguards and browser audio/video code remain deliberate Web adaptations.


## Follow-up review (2026-10-09)

The original Web import hero and hardware chips were replaced by the source's
compact Files service card. Supported extensions are in a collapsible helper.
The redundant About entry is omitted; credits and licenses remain in Other.
Shared native row
builders now live in ui.js and are re-exported by manic-ui.js for its callers;
their DOM and escaping behavior are unchanged. The original Swift references
remain byte-identical. Local recovery, offline updates and file validation are
browser adaptations; they do not add cloud/account/upload services.

## Skin library (modified 2026-10-09)

SkinSettingsView, SkinCollectionViewCell, AddSkinCollectionViewCell and
SkinPreviewViewController guide the two-column library, current-selection marker,
portrait/landscape preview tabs, separate enlarged preview and Add card.
The three additional Swift files are retained unmodified at the same revision.
Implementation: src/skin-settings.js, src/skin-preview.js and style.css.
Imported records remain in IndexedDB when selection or a standard palette changes.
The last platform is retained so reopening cannot silently hide another platform.
The simplified Web preference still selects one skin for both orientations;
orientation tabs change previews. Per-game inheritance and standard layout editing
remain. Deletion is an edit action followed by confirmation, without multi-delete,
cloud synchronization or bundled third-party skin artwork. Preview image URLs
and screen renderers have independent lifetimes from gameplay.
